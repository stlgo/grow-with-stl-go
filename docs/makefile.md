# Makefile

## What is a makefile?

Makefile is a defined set of tasks that is executed using [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).  This allows anyone to build the application without knowing in depth each applicable command to do it.  In the context of this application the makefile defines the following:

- [build](#build): causes make to execute the steps for a frontend and a backend build
- [lint](#lint): causes make to execute the steps for a frontend and backend code lint
- [test](#test): causes make to execute the steps for backend unit tests
- [coverage](#coverage): causes make to execute steps for unit test coverage
- [verify](#verify): causes make to execute the steps to execute build, lint and coverage
- [dist](#dist): causes make to execute the steps to build a binary distribution

This information is sourced from the [Makefile](Makefile) inside the project

## Build

Make build will cause a general binary build command for the backend and frontend

### Example Make Build

To run a build command run: make build

```bash
$ make build
Executing frontend build steps...

up to date, audited 112 packages in 741ms

25 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
Frontend build completed successfully
Executing backend build steps...
Backend build completed successfully
```

### Makefile Build Definitions

#### Build Makefile Commands

```makefile
.PHONY: build
build: frontend-build
build: backend-build
```

#### Frontend Build

```makefile
.PHONY: frontend-build
frontend-build:
 @echo "Executing frontend build steps..."
 @cd $(WEB_DIR) && npm install && cd ..
 @echo "Frontend build completed successfully"
```

#### Backend Build

```makefile
.PHONY: backend-build
backend-build:
 @echo "Executing backend build steps..."
 @mkdir -p $(BUILD_DIR)
 @go build -o $(MAIN)$(EXTENSION) $(GO_FLAGS) cmd/main.go
 @echo "Backend build completed successfully"
```

## Lint

Make lint will cause linters to be run on both the front end and back end

### Example Make Lint

To run a lint command run: make lint

```bash
$ make lint
Checking that go.mod is up to date...
go.mod check completed successfully
